React Chat Application
This is a simple real-time chat application built with React and Socket.IO. The app allows users to join chat rooms, send messages, and communicate with other users either in a room or via personal messages.

Features
Real-time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real time.
Room Management: Join and chat in specific rooms.
Personal Chat: Send direct messages to specific users using their Socket ID.
User Identification: Users can set their username, which will be displayed with each message.
Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
Socket.IO: For real-time communication between clients and server.
Material-UI: For UI components and styling.
Setup and Installation

Make sure the server is running on http://localhost:3000.

Frontend Setup

Customization
Styling: The app uses Material-UI for styling. You can customize the UI components by modifying the sx props or creating custom styles in the src folder.
Server URL: The app is currently set to connect to a server running on http://localhost:3000. If your server is hosted elsewhere, update the URL in the useMemo hook inside App.js.
Future Enhancements
User Authentication: Implement user login and registration.
Message Persistence: Save chat history in a database.
Typing Indicators: Show when someone is typing in the chat.
File Sharing: Enable users to share files in the chat.
